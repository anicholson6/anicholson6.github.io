# Welcome!
Below is a collection of projects I've done in both my free time and as part of my MSCS coursework. All projects are Python based with various packages.


## Academic Technical Write-ups
### [MSCS Technical Portfolio](https://github.com/anicholson6/MSCS-Portfolio) 
Detailed technical write-ups of my Georgia Tech master's coursework (Jan 2023-Aug 2025). Each README discusses the problem statement, implementation strategies, and experimental results for a specific project.

## Professional Projects
### [Solar Energy Accessibility Analysis](https://github.com/anicholson6/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/DS4A_Capstone)
Group capstone for the Data Science for All program. We used a multi-source data approach to identify market barriers and regional adoption trends for residential solar energy. Our findings were presented as a report, datafolio, and Tableau dashboard.


### [Propensity Score Matching](https://github.com/anicholson6/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/propensity_match)
Determine whether a job training program had a positive effect on employees' future earnings vs a control. Used propensity score matching to remove covariant imbalance before determining whether the skewed treated group had an actual incremental lift.


### [Uplift  Modeling](https://github.com/anicholson6/Personal-Portfolio/tree/main/uplift-models)
Use uplift modeling to identify customers that will make a conversion if exposed to an ad, and determine the incremental gain over a control group. Method was compared across three meta learners - S, T, and X.
